# Project 1 Machine Learning Implementations
This repository has in the implementations.py file multiple basic ML implementations. They are interconnected in the run.ipynb file.

## Implementations
The implementations in implementations.py are currently least squares and logistic regressions.

Least squares use normal equations and logistic regression uses gradient descent for y \in {0, 1}

## An interconnected example
In run.ipynb one can see an interconnected example of all the methods used in implemnentations.py. The data is further loaded and standardized before doing any Machine Learning related tasks.

## Things to do further
Further, one may use the correlation matrix to retrieve highly correlated features and reduce the model size. Another option would be principle component analysis and try k validation sets.
